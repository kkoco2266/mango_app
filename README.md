# Mango Damage Detection App

This is a web application that detects damages on mangoes using a TensorFlow model with Django as the frontend framework and FastAPI as the API for serving the model. The application allows users to upload images of mangoes and get predictions about the damage.

## Features

- **Multilabel classification**: Detects multiple types of damage such as Anthracnose, Bacterial-Black-spot, and more.
- **Django**: Used for the frontend and handling user uploads.
- **FastAPI**: API for serving TensorFlow models and returning predictions.
- **TensorFlow**: Pre-trained model for mango damage classification.


## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or above
- Django 3.2+
- FastAPI
- TensorFlow 2.6+
- Uvicorn (for running FastAPI)

## Installation

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mango-damage-detection.git
cd mango_app
```
### Set up a virtual environment and activate it

```bash
# For Unix-based systems (Linux/MacOS)
python3 -m venv django-env
source django-env/bin/activate

# For Windows
python -m venv django-env

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Set up Django app
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### Run the Django server
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### Run the FastAPI app
In a separate terminal window, navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
uvicorn fastapi_app.api:app --reload --port 8001
```

The FastAPI app will run at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### Access the application
Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to upload a mango image and get damage predictions.
